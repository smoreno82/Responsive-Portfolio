      <p>Hi! My name is Stephanie Moreno. I was born and raised in a small town located in the west Texas area. So I guess you could say I've had enough dirt storms, and front row seats to pumpjacks and tumble weeds to last a life time. The town is called Pampa. No one goes there on purpose.

        After graduating from Texas Tech University, I've since then made my way to Dallas, which is much more my pace. I love Dallas. Seperately from that, I have two fur babies named Bruiser and Enzo. They keep me very busy and I love them to pieces! For fun, I like to run, eat good food, hike, hang with my most tolderable friends, and attend social networking events. In time, I'll re-write this bio to sound much more professional and interesting. Meanwhile, thanks for spending 2 minutes of your life to read it.</p>
